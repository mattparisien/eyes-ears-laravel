          E&E’s thorough research on local causes, collaborative approach with Charlie, and swift execution of the event took away any stress surrounding the campaign and allowed us to focus on creating a meaningful experience for Charlie’s fans while also making a sizable donation to City Harvest.

          In addition to City Harvest, Sammy and Eyes & Ears have been instrumental in Charlie’s partnership(s) with Leah Thomas and the Intersectional Environmentalist movement. Her focus, organization, and motivation guided each of these activations - and we’re excited to continue collaborating!
