      I believe music is a language of connection and a powerful tool to spread waves of change.

      In January 2020, during my senior year at Syracuse University where I studied the music business in the Bandier Program, I founded The Eyes & Ears Agency. Here, I discovered the opportunity to marry my passion for music with my love of social impact work.

      I have held several roles working in both the non-profit (Global Inheritance) and for-profit (Nvak Collective) sectors of the industry, amplifying creative activism and supporting the careers of female, non-binary, and LGBTQ+ artists in emerging markets respectively. I bring both these perspectives to my work at The Eyes & Ears Agency, creating social impact partnerships that are scalable, impactful, and educational.

      I am dedicated to increasing visibility and accessibility to social impact resources within the music and entertainment industries.

      I am humbled to play a role in the new generation of artist-activists who are directly engaged in the change they want to see in the world.
