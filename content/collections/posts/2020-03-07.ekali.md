In order to generate the greatest impact, it was important to raise awareness as well as funds to support ARISE’s mental health and wellness programs. Through the partnership, a portion of Ekali’s merchandise sales at the Westcott Theater on March 7, 2020 were donated to ARISE. The Eyes & Ears Agency also arranged for ARISE to have an information booth at Ekali’s show where two clinicians were present to answer questions, provide information about the organization’s services, and spread awareness about their mission and work.'
