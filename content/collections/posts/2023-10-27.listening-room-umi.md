            text: 'UMI is a 24-year-old Seattle native pioneering a new sound rooted in neo soul and folk. Her deepest intention is to use her music as a vessel for healing and human connection. Meaning ocean in Japanese, "umi" is a beautiful reflection of her artistry - soothing like a day spent in nature. She flows across melodies and allows herself to dive into the human experience in a way that leaves listeners feeling deeply understood. UMI''s Japanese roots as well as her life journeys as a Queer woman can be felt throughout the themes of her songs. The energy of her melodies reflects her personality - deeply caring and inviting. Currently living in Los Angeles, UMI continues to create genre-bending music that captivates and inspires listeners.'
