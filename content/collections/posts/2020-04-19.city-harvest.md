The Eyes & Ears Agency facilitated a donation-based virtual meet and greet with his fans. This unique and intimate experience ultimately strengthened Burg’s relationship with his audience, while offering an opportunity to educate them on a cause and organization close to his heart. The virtual meet and greet raised funds in support of City Harvest’s ‘Skip Lunch Fight Hunger’ campaign, and helped the organization move towards their goal of rescuing 20 million pounds of food to meet increased needs during the pandemic. City Harvest is all about New Yorkers taking care of each other and as a current Bushwick resident, Burg wanted to help his neighbors as best he could.'

This experience reminded us of the power of connectivity, brought Burg even closer to his fans, and got them more excited for his upcoming single release!'

    caption: 'yo guys! we thought of a fun live idea to help contribute to those effected by the virus. at the link in my bio you’ll find a page where you can donate to City Harvest, a charity dedicating to feeding New Yorkers who are struggling to put food on their tables. the first 100 people to donate just $5 to the cause i’m gonna invite to a Zoom call where we can talk, answer questions, play some songs, whatever ! i’m also gonna match every $5 donation up to $500 ! Send an email with a screenshot that u donated to info@dionysian.co and the first 100 in will get a zoom link for this weekend. so much love to @eyes__ears for conceiving of and facilitating this❤️'
